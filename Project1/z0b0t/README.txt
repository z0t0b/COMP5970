- Put the unzipped contents in any area on the target computer
- Make sure the z0b0t server is running on the same machine or a different machine on the same local network
- Right click on z0b0t.exe and click "Run as Administrator"
- The tool should take care of the rest!

### COMMON ERRORS ###
- Command prompt and one PowerShell instance will open briefly on the target computer; this is normal, don't worry
- If you see red text flash on the PowerShell instances then something has gone wrong. If this is the case, you will have to modify the source code to fit your specific task (i.e., if a certain port is blocked, you must change the source code for the server and the client so they connect on a different port).
